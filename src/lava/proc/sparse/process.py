    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : scipy.sparse.spmatrix or np.ndarray
        2D connection weight matrix of form
        (num_flat_output_neurons, num_flat_input_neurons).

    weight_exp : int, optional
        Shared weight exponent of base 2 used to scale magnitude of
        weights, if needed. Mostly for fixed point implementations.
        Unnecessary for floating point implementations.
        Default value is 0.

    num_weight_bits : int, optional
        Shared weight width/precision used by weight. Mostly for fixed
        point implementations. Unnecessary for floating point
        implementations.
        Default is for weights to use full 8 bit precision.

    sign_mode : SignMode, optional
        Shared indicator whether synapse is of type SignMode.NULL,
        SignMode.MIXED, SignMode.EXCITATORY, or SignMode.INHIBITORY. If
        SignMode.MIXED, the sign of the weight is
        included in the weight bits and the fixed point weight used for
        inference is scaled by 2.
        Unnecessary for floating point implementations.

        In the fixed point implementation, weights are scaled according to
        the following equations:
        w_scale = 8 - num_weight_bits + weight_exp + isMixed()
        weights = weights * (2 ** w_scale)

    num_message_bits : int, optional
        Determines whether the Sparse Process deals with the incoming
        spikes as binary spikes (num_message_bits = 0) or as graded
        spikes (num_message_bits > 0). Default is 0.
