class Readout(AbstractProcess):
    """ Readout process of the CLP system. It receives the output spikes from
     PrototypeLIF neurons, look up the label of the winner prototype and
     send it out to the user as the inferred label.
     Additionally, if the winner neuron does not have a label this process
     assigns a pseudo-label (a negative-valued label) for the time-being.
     When a user-provided label is available, this process refer to the most
     recent predicted label. If that is a pseudo-label, then it assigns the
     user-provided label to this neuron. On the other hand if that is a
     normal label (i.e. a positive number) then the process will check the
     correctness of the predicted label and provide feedback through another
     channel

    Parameters
        ----------
        n_protos : int
            Number of Prototype LIF neurons that this process need to read from.
        proto_labels : numpy.ndarray, optional
            Initial labels of the Prototype LIF neurons. If not provided,
            by default this array will be initialized with zeros, meaning
            they are not labelled.
