    "## What is a _Process_?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to create a _Process_ that simulates a group of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. But in Lava, the concept of _Processes_ applies widely beyond this example. In general, a _Process_ describes an individual program unit which encapsulates\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>data that store its state,</li>\n",
    "<li>algorithms that describe how to manipulate the data,</li>\n",
    "<li>ports that share data with other Processes, and </li>\n",
    "<li>an API that facilitates user interaction.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "A _Process_ can thus be as simple as a single neuron or a synapse, as complex as a full neural network, and as non-neuromorphic as a streaming interface for a peripheral device or an executed instance of regular program code.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lava-nc/lava-nc.github.io/main/_static/images/tutorial02/fig01_processes.png\" width=\"1000\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "_Processes_ are independent from each other as they primarily operate on their own local memory while they pass messages between each other via channels. Different _Processes_ thus proceed their computations simultaneously and asynchronously, mirroring the high parallelism inherent in neuromorphic hardware. The parallel _Processes_ are furthermore safe against side effects from shared-memory interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a _Process_ has been coded in Python, Lava allows to run it seamlessly across different backends such as a CPU, a GPU, or neuromorphic cores. Developers can thus easily test and benchmark their applications on classical computing hardware and then deploy it to neuromorphic hardware. Furthermore, Lava takes advantage of distributed, heterogeneous hardware such as Loihi as it can run some _Processes_ on neuromorphic cores and in parallel others on embedded conventional CPUs and GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Lava provides a growing [library of Processes](https://github.com/lava-nc/lava/tree/main/src/lava/proc \"Lava's process library\"), you can easily write your own processes that suit your needs."
