    "# Serialization of Lava networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Lava network can be saved to and later loaded from a file, this is also called serialization. Serialization of Lava networks, a list of Lava processes which are optionally connected and/or compiled, is based on the pickle module from python. The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Serialization of compiled Lava networks allows to easily share bigger Lava networks and to execute pre-compiled networks. This enables to run networks which take a long time to compile faster, which decreases the time to execution. Pre-compilation also enables the execution of complex networks on embedded environments, which otherwise would suffer from long compilation times.\n",

    "> **⚠️ Warning**  \n",
    "> Using `save` and `load` is not secure. Only load data you trust.\n",
    "> As it uses pickle it is possible to construct malicious data which will execute arbitrary code during loading. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.\n",

    "> Consider signing data with `hmac` if you need to ensure that it has not been tampered with."
